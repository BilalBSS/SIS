The Sunshine Inventory System aims to function as an efficient inventory tracker for Sunshine School, focusing on monitoring various school equipment, including chairs, desks, whiteboards, chalk, textbooks, computers, lab equipment, and stationary. 
The primary users of this system will be school administrators, particularly those responsible for managing the school's inventory.

The development of the Sunshine Inventory System (SIS) is anticipated to bring three key advantages to Sunshine School. Firstly, by facilitating the streamlined tracking of school resources, SIS will contribute to a reduction in restocking time, ensuring timely availability of equipment, thereby benefiting teachers, administrators, and students alike. 
Secondly, SIS aims to minimize waste by monitoring resource utilization and identifying excess resources. This, in turn, is expected to enhance decision-making processes related to the purchase and sale of equipment. 
Lastly, the comprehensive tracking of resources facilitated by the Sunshine Inventory System is projected to decrease the school's overall cost of resource management.
